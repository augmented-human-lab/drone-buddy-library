<h2>YOLO<a class="headerlink" href="#yolo" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a popular object detection algorithm known for its fast and real-time performance. It stands out for its ability to simultaneously predict object classes and bounding box coordinates in a single forward pass through a deep neural network.</p>
<p>Please refer to the [YOLOv5](<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.ultralytics.com/">https://docs.ultralytics.com/</a>) documentation for more details.
Here’s a simplified explanation of how YOLO works:</p>
<p>Dividing the Image into Grid: YOLO divides the input image into a grid of cells. Each cell is responsible for predicting objects located within its boundaries.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Anchor Boxes: YOLO uses pre-defined anchor boxes, which are a set of bounding box shapes with different aspect ratios. These anchor boxes are initially defined based on the characteristics of the dataset being used.</p></li>
<li><p>Prediction: The neural network is designed to simultaneously predict multiple bounding boxes and their corresponding class probabilities within each grid cell. For each anchor box, the network predicts the coordinates (x, y, width, height) of the bounding box and the confidence score representing the likelihood of containing an object. It also predicts class probabilities for each object class.</p></li>
<li><p>Non-Maximum Suppression: YOLO applies a post-processing step called non-maximum suppression (NMS) to remove duplicate or overlapping bounding box predictions. NMS selects the most confident detection among overlapping boxes based on a defined threshold.</p></li>
<li><p>Output: The final output of the YOLO algorithm is a set of bounding boxes along with their class labels and confidence scores, representing the detected objects in the image.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>YOLO’s key advantages lie in its speed and efficiency. Since it performs object detection in a single pass through the neural network, it avoids the need for region proposals or sliding windows, resulting in faster inference times. This makes YOLO suitable for real-time applications like video analysis, robotics, and autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>YOLO has evolved over time, and different versions such as YOLOv1, YOLOv2 (also known as YOLO9000), YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOv8 have been introduced. These iterations have incorporated various improvements, including network architecture changes, feature extraction enhancements, and the use of more advanced techniques like skip connections and feature pyramid networks.</p>
<p>YOLO models are typically trained on large labeled datasets, such as COCO (Common Objects in Context), to learn to detect objects across multiple classes effectively. The training process involves optimizing the neural network parameters using techniques like backpropagation and gradient descent.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that while YOLO offers fast inference times, it may sacrifice some accuracy compared to slower, more complex object detection algorithms. The choice of object detection algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the application, balancing factors like accuracy, speed, and available computational resources.</p>
