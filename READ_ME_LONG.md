## Installation

DroneBuddy can be easily installed as a Python library. However, before proceeding, ensure that you meet the following prerequisites, as they are crucial for certain machine learning models used by DroneBuddy:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Visual C++: Install it through [Visual C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/), selecting the option for CMake during installation.
- Rust: Install it from [Rust's official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and add it to the system path.
- CMake: Install CMake and add it to the system path as well.
- `pip install setuptools-rust`

#### Installing Visual C++

##### Windows Installation Guide

1. Visit [Visual C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).
2. Download Microsoft C++ Build Tools.
3. Install it and select "Desktop development with C++" during installation.

#### Install CMake

CMake is necessary to install the dlib library, which, in turn, is required for the face recognition model used to identify known individuals. You can find the official installation guidelines [here](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/issues/175#issue-257710508).

Download the Windows installer for CMake [here](https://cmake.org/download/). After running it, ensure that CMake is added to the system path (e.g., `C:\Program Files\CMake\bin`).

#### Rust Installation

Rust is needed to install the intent recognition library used to interpret commands given to the drone. Download Rust from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and follow the installation instructions.

For macOS installation, if you encounter a permission error, follow the steps [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45899815/could-not-write-to-bash-profile-when-installing-rust-on-macos-sierra).

Try using this without sudo:

```shell
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- --help
```

If that works, you can try:

```shell
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- --no-modify-path
```

If the command with the `--no-modify-path` option works, manually update `.bash_profile` to include it in your path:

```shell
source ~/.cargo/env
```

Now you're ready to install DroneBuddy.

To install DroneBuddy as you would any other library, run:

```shell
pip install dronebuddylib
```

## Functionalities

After installing the `dronebuddylib`, you can initialize the voice recognition engine and use it to control your drone. Remember to run your code within a virtual environment to prevent potential issues.

### Voice Recognition

Voice recognition, also known as speech recognition, enables computers to understand and interpret spoken language, converting it into text or actionable commands. Here's a simplified overview of how voice recognition works:

1. **Audio Input**: Voice recognition systems primarily take audio input, which can be sourced from microphones, audio files, or real-time audio streams. DroneBuddy uses audio input from your computer.

2. **Pre-processing**: Pre-processing techniques enhance the quality of the input by removing background noise, normalizing volume, and applying filters.

3. **Acoustic Analysis**: Audio input is analyzed to extract acoustic features, including frequency, intensity, and sound duration.

4. **Acoustic Model**: This model associates acoustic features with speech sounds or phonemes.

5. **Language Model**: A language model understands context and improves recognition accuracy. It predicts likely word sequences based on acoustic input.

6. **Speech Recognition**: Acoustic and language models collaborate to match observed acoustic features with known language patterns, resulting in the most probable word sequence.

7. **Output Generation**: Recognized words or phrases are generated as text output, which can be further processed or used as input for various applications.

Voice recognition technology continues to evolve and find applications in dictation software, transcription services, virtual assistants, and more.

### VOSK

DroneBuddy uses the VOSK model for voice recognition. VOSK employs an acoustic model and a language model to convert audio into text. You can learn more about VOSK on [alphacephei.com](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/).

#### Acoustic Model

VOSK uses deep neural networks to analyze raw audio input, converting it into acoustic features, such as frequency and intensity.

#### Language Model

VOSK employs a language model that incorporates grammar, vocabulary, and context to predict word sequences based on acoustic features.

#### Speech Recognition

VOSK combines acoustic and language models to perform speech recognition, comparing observed acoustic features with a database of pre-recorded speech samples.

#### Transcription

After speech recognition, VOSK generates text transcriptions of spoken words.

### How to Use with DroneBuddy

To use voice recognition with DroneBuddy, follow these steps:

1. Initialize the voice engine:

```python
speech_to_text_engine = dbl.init_speech_to_text_engine('en-us')
```

2. Recognize general speech:

```python
recognized = dbl.recognize_speech(speech_to_text_engine, audio_feed=data)
```

3. Recognize predefined commands:

```python
recognized = dbl.recognize_command(speech_to_text_engine, audio_feed=data)
```

Sample code for controlling the drone using voice commands:

```python
import dronebuddylib as dbl
import pyaudio
from djitellopy import Tello
from dronebuddylib import DroneCommands

# Initialize Tello instance
tello = Tello()
listening = False
tello.connect()
tello.streamon()

mic = pyaudio.PyAudio()

# Initialize speech-to-text engine
speech_to_text_engine = dbl.init_speech_to_text_engine('en-us')

# This method receives audio input from pyaudio and returns the command
try:
            stream.start_stream()
            data = stream.read(8192)
            recognized = dbl.recognize_command(speech_to_text_engine, audio_feed=data)
            if recognized is not None:
                listening = False
                stream.close()
                return recognized
        except Exception as e:
            print(e)

def analyse_command(recognized):
    try:
        if recognized == DroneCommands.TAKEOFF:
            tello.takeoff()
        # Add other functionalities and scenarios here
           tello.takeoff()
       # you can add any functionality here, and handle all the scenarios
       elif recognized == DroneCommands.LAND:
           tello.land()
   except Exception as e:
       print(e)

def control_the_drone():
  command = get_command()
  analyse_command(command)
```


# Intent Recognition

Intent recognition, also known as intent detection or intent classification, is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to identify the intention or purpose behind a given piece of text. It helps computers understand the meaning and intention behind human language, enabling them to respond appropriately.

Here's a simplified explanation of how intent recognition works:

1. **Text Input**: Intent recognition takes a text input, typically a user's query, command, or statement, as its primary source of information. This text input can be in the form of a sentence, a phrase, or even a single word.

2. **Pre-processing**: Before analyzing the text, intent recognition systems often perform pre-processing steps. These steps may include removing punctuation, converting the text to lowercase, removing stop words (common words like "the," "is," etc.), and handling any other necessary formatting or cleaning.

3. **Feature Extraction**: Intent recognition systems extract relevant features from the pre-processed text. These features can include words, word combinations (n-grams), part-of-speech tags, syntactic structures, or any other linguistic information that helps capture the meaning and context of the text.

4. **Training Data**: Intent recognition models require training data to learn how to classify different intents. Training data consists of labeled examples where each text input is associated with a specific intent. For instance, if the system is designed to recognize user commands, the training data might contain examples like "Play a song," "Stop the video," etc., along with their corresponding intents.

5. **Machine Learning Model**: Machine learning techniques, such as supervised learning, are commonly used for intent recognition. A model is trained on the labeled training data, learning the patterns and relationships between the extracted features and the corresponding intents.

6. **Intent Classification**: Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the intent of new, unseen text inputs. The trained model takes the extracted features from the new text input and applies the learned patterns to classify it into one or more predefined intents. The predicted intent represents the underlying meaning or purpose of the text.

7. **Output Generation**: The predicted intent is generated as output, providing information about the user's intention. This output can be further processed to trigger specific actions, retrieve relevant information, or provide appropriate responses based on the recognized intent.

Intent recognition is widely used in various applications, such as chatbots, virtual assistants, customer support systems, and voice-controlled devices. It enables these systems to understand user queries, commands, or statements and respond accordingly, providing a more interactive and personalized user experience.

It's important to note that the accuracy of intent recognition depends on the quality and diversity of the training data, the effectiveness of feature extraction techniques, and the robustness of the machine learning model employed.

## SNIPS NLU

Snips NLU (Natural Language Understanding) is an open-source library designed to perform intent recognition and slot filling, two essential tasks in natural language processing. It allows computers to understand the meaning and extract relevant information from user queries or commands.

### Training Data

Snips NLU requires training data to learn how to understand and process user queries. Training data consists of labeled examples, including user queries and their corresponding intents and slots. Intents represent the user's intention, while slots capture specific pieces of information within the query.

### Intent Recognition

Snips NLU uses machine learning algorithms to train a model on the provided training data. During training, the model learns to recognize different intents by analyzing the patterns and relationships between the words or features in the queries and their corresponding intents. The trained model can then predict the intent of new, unseen queries.

### Slot Filling

In addition to intent recognition, Snips NLU also performs slot filling. Slot filling involves identifying and extracting specific information or parameters (slots) from the user's query. For example, in the query "Book a table for two at 7 PM," the slots could be "table" (slot type: restaurant table) and "time" (slot type: time). Snips NLU learns to recognize and extract these slots based on the patterns observed in the training data.

### Model Deployment

Once the model is trained, it can be deployed and integrated into your application or system. Snips NLU provides a simple API that allows you to send user queries to the model and receive the recognized intent and extracted slots as the output.

### Intent Recognition and Slot Filling in Action

When a user query is sent to the deployed Snips NLU model, it processes the text and predicts the intent based on the learned patterns. Additionally, it identifies and extracts relevant slots from the query, providing structured information about the user's request.

### Output Generation

The recognized intent and extracted slots are generated as output, enabling your application to understand the user's intention and access the specific information provided in the query. This output can be further processed to trigger appropriate actions or provide relevant responses based on the recognized intent and slots.

Snips NLU is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing you to train models specific to your domain or application. It provides tools to annotate training data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.

By using Snips NLU, you can incorporate natural language understanding capabilities into your applications, such as chatbots, voice assistants, or any system that requires understanding and processing of user queries.

### How to Use it with DroneBuddy

#### Install setuptools-rust

To install setuptools-rust on Windows, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Rust**: setuptools-rust requires Rust to be installed on your system. You can download and install Rust from the official website at [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

2. **Install Visual C++ Build Tools**: setuptools-rust also requires the Visual C++ Build Tools to be installed on your system. You can download and install them from the Microsoft website at [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).

3. **Install Python**: If you haven't already, you need to install Python on your system. You can download and install the latest version of Python from the official website at [https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).

5. **Install setuptools-rust**: In the command prompt, navigate to the directory where you want to install setuptools-rust, and run the following command:

   ```shell
   pip install setuptools-rust
   ```

   This will download and install setuptools-rust and its dependencies.

   Note: If you encounter any errors during the installation process, try upgrading pip to the latest version by running `pip install --upgrade pip` before installing setuptools-rust. You may also need to add Rust and the Visual C++ Build Tools to your system's PATH environment variable.

#### Install Snips NLU

You can install Snips NLU using pip:

```shell
pip install snips-nlu
```

#### Create Dataset

A sample training set is already created with the most common use

 cases for the drone. It can be accessed in the location:

```
dronebuddylib/atoms/resources/intentrecognition/
```

The standard training set contains a defined set of entities and intents.

##### Intents

Intents define what the intended objective of a phrase is. You can define the intent according to the needs of the drone. Currently, the defined intents are defined in the enum class `DroneCommands` to ease the programming. This can be overridden anytime.

**Defining Intents**

```yaml
# takeoff intent
---
type: intent
name: TAKE_OFF
slots:
 - name: DroneName
   entity: DroneName
 - name: address
   entity: address_entity
utterances:
 - Take off the [DroneName](quadcopter) from the ground.
 - "[address](sammy) Launch the [DroneName](hexacopter) and make it fly."
 - hey [address](sammy), get in the air.
 - Lift off from the launchpad.
 - take off
 - hey [address](sammy),launch
 - fly
 - "[address](sammy) can you please take off"
 - hey [address](sammy), can you please launch
 - can you please fly
 - hey [address](sammy), can you please take off [DroneName](this)
```

Utterances refer to the training sentences that should be used to train the specific intent. Generally, these should cover a lot of possible variations to improve intent recognition accuracy.

You can cover all the intents that you need when programming the drone.

##### Entities

Entities refer to the entities that need to be recognized in the conversation. For example, these can be distance, names, locations, directions.

**Defining Entities**

```yaml
# address Entity
---
type: entity
name: address_entity
values:
 - [sammy, semi, semmi, sami, sammi, semmi]  # Entity value with synonyms
```

In the default case, the entity is defined as the name to address the drone. The entity is defined as `address_entity`, and this can be retrieved in the recognized intent.

The response will be as follows:

```json
{
  "input": "sammy can you move 10m to your right? ",
  "intent": {
    "intentName": "RIGHT",
    "probability": 1
  },
  "slots": [
    {
      "range": {
        "start": 0,
        "end": 5
      },
      "rawValue": "sammy",
      "value": {
        "kind": "Custom",
        "value": "sammy"
      },
      "entity": "address_entity",
      "slotName": "address"
    },
    {
      "range": {
        "start": 19,
        "end": 22
      },
      "rawValue": "10m",
      "value": {
        "kind": "Custom",
        "value": "10m"
      },
      "entity": "distance_entity",
      "slotName": "distance"
    }
  ]
}
```

This feature was introduced to reduce the noise of the voice recognition. When the drone is tested in a noisy environment, the drone responds to every conversation. In order to stop this, you can enable the activation phrase feature, which enables you to command the drone by addressing the drone directly by its name. The default name is "sammy," which was selected as the probability of it being misrecognized is comparatively lower. If you need to change the name, you need to alter the training data set according to your needs.

The method `is_addressed_to_drone` can be used to decide whether the drone is being addressed or not.

#### Train the NLU

If you are planning to override the existing data set, you can simply create a dataset.yaml file. Modify the paths in the following command to generate the JSON file.

```shell
snips-nlu generate-dataset en C:\Users\janedoe\projects\DroneBuddy\drone-buddy-library\dronebuddylib\resources\intentrecognition\dataset.yaml > C:\Users\janedoe\projects\DroneBuddy\drone-buddy-library\dronebuddylib\resources\intentrecognition\dataset.json
```

#### Using the NLU

Once the training JSON is created, pass the location of the file to the init function. If you are using the default NLU, there is no need to pass anything; it will be using the default configurations. For now, DroneBuddy only supports English.

```python
init_intent_recognition_engine(dataset_path: str = None, config: str = CONFIG_EN)
```

This method will return `intent_recognition_engine`, which can then be passed on to the other methods to use the intent recognition feature.

#### Recognize Intent

```python
recognize_intent(engine: SnipsNLUEngine, text: str)
```

Pass the text phrase along with the initialized intent engine, and the method will return the recognized intent object. This result will contain the intent and the recognized entities collected into slots.

#### Extracting the Intent

You can simply use the following method to extract the intent:

```python
get_intent_name(intent, threshold=0.5)
```

- `intent`: Recognized intent that is returned from `recognize_intent()` method.
- `threshold`: Threshold refers to the cutoff probability. Default cutoff is 0.5, which means if the probability of the resolved intent is less than 0.5, then the method will return None; otherwise, it will return the intent.

#### Getting the Mentioned Entities

When the recognized intent object is passed into the method, if there are any recognized entities, the method will return key-value pairs of the entity name and the value.

```python
recognized_entities = dbl.get_mentioned_entities(recognized_intent)
name_of_the_person = recognized_entities['address_entity']
```

#### Activation Phrase

If you need to integrate the activation phrase, you can use the following method. This method is made to decide whether a certain phrase is directed to the drone. Pass on the recognized intent, the name in which the NLU is trained, and if there are similar pronunciations or similar spellings, then it will return a boolean.

```python
is_addressed_to_drone(intent, name='sammy', similar_pronunciation=None)
```


# Face Recognition

## General

Face recognition is a technology that identifies or verifies a person's identity by analyzing their facial features. It is commonly used in various applications, such as security systems, access control, biometric authentication, and surveillance.

Here's a simplified explanation of how face recognition works:

### Face Detection

The face recognition process begins with face detection, where an algorithm locates and detects faces within an image or a video stream. This involves analyzing the visual information to identify areas that potentially contain faces.

### Face Alignment

Once faces are detected, face alignment techniques are applied to normalize the face's position and orientation. This step helps ensure that the subsequent analysis focuses on the important facial features, regardless of slight variations in pose or facial expression.

### Feature Extraction

In this step, the facial features are extracted from the aligned face image. Various algorithms, such as eigenfaces, local binary patterns, or deep neural networks, are used to analyze the unique characteristics of the face and represent them as numerical feature vectors. These feature vectors capture information about the geometry, texture, and other distinctive aspects of the face.

### Training

Face recognition systems require training with labeled examples to learn how to identify individuals. During the training phase, the system learns to map the extracted facial features to specific identities. It builds a model or database that represents the known faces and their corresponding features.

### Face Matching

When a face needs to be recognized, the system compares the extracted features of the query face with the features stored in the trained model or database. It calculates the similarity or distance between the feature vectors to determine the closest matches. The recognition algorithm uses statistical methods or machine learning techniques to make this comparison.

### Recognition Decision

Based on the calculated similarity scores, the system makes a recognition decision. If a sufficiently close match is found in the database, the face is recognized as belonging to a specific individual. Otherwise, if the match is not close enough, the system may classify the face as unknown.

Face recognition systems can be designed for different purposes, such as one-to-one verification (confirming whether a person is who they claim to be) or one-to-many identification (finding a person's identity from a large database). The level of accuracy and performance can vary based on factors such as image quality, variations in lighting and pose, and the quality of the face recognition algorithm used.

## `face_recognition` Library

`face_recognition` is an open-source Python library that provides face detection, face alignment, and face recognition capabilities.

Here's a simplified explanation of how the "face_recognition" library works:

### Installation

To use the "face_recognition" library, you need to install it first. You can install it via pip by running the following command in your Python environment:

```shell
pip install face_recognition
```

### Face Detection

The library utilizes pre-trained models to detect faces in images or video frames. It can detect multiple faces in an image and return the bounding box coordinates (top, right, bottom, left) for each detected face. The detection process uses computer vision algorithms to locate the presence and location of faces.

### Face Alignment

After face detection, the library can perform face alignment to normalize the face's position and orientation. This helps improve the accuracy of subsequent face recognition tasks by aligning the faces to a standardized pose.

### Feature Extraction

The library extracts facial features from the aligned face images. It employs a deep learning-based method to capture important characteristics of the face. These features are represented as numerical feature vectors that encode information about the face's geometry, texture, and other discriminative details.

### Face Recognition

Using the extracted feature vectors, the "face_recognition" library can perform face recognition by comparing the features of a query face with the features of known faces stored in a database. It calculates the similarity or distance between the feature vectors and determines the closest matches. You can specify a threshold to define the level of similarity required for a positive recognition.

### Usage

To use the library, you typically load an image or video frame, detect faces, align the faces (optional), and then extract and compare the face features for recognition. The library provides easy-to-use functions and classes to perform these tasks, allowing you to integrate face recognition capabilities into your Python applications.

It's worth noting that the "face_recognition" library is built on top of popular deep learning frameworks like dlib and OpenCV. It provides a high-level interface to simplify face recognition tasks and abstracts away the complexities of model training and implementation.

Remember that face recognition accuracy can be influenced by factors such as image quality, variations in lighting and pose, and the number of training examples available for known faces. Therefore, it's important to consider these factors and perform proper testing and fine-tuning to achieve optimal results in your specific use case.

- [face_recognition GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/issues/175#issue-257710508)

## How to Use

### Add Faces to the Memory

In order to proceed with face recognition, the algorithm needs encodings of the known faces. The library has a method that is specifically designed to add these faces to the memory.

```python
file_path = r"D:\projects\drone-buddy-library\test\jane.jpg"
result = dbl.add_people_to_memory("jane.png", "jane", file_path)
```

You can check if the images and names are added to the library by simply going to the location where the library is installed:

```
newvenv/Lib/site-packages/dronebuddylib/atoms/resources
```

### Recognize Faces

To use the recognition feature, you can use the `find_all_the_faces` method by simply feeding the frame to it. The `show_feed` variable refers to whether to show the video feed in a new window. The default setting for this is false. The method returns a list of names of the people in the frame, and if not recognized, it will return "unknown."

# Object Detection

## General

Object detection is a computer vision technique that involves locating and classifying objects within images or video frames. It goes beyond simple image classification by not only identifying the presence of objects but also providing information about their precise locations within the scene.

Here's a simplified explanation of how object detection works:

### Image Preprocessing

The object detection process typically starts with some preprocessing steps, such as resizing, normalization, or adjusting the image's color channels. These steps help prepare the image for further analysis and improve the accuracy of object detection algorithms.

### Feature Extraction

Object detection algorithms employ various techniques to extract features from the image that represent meaningful patterns or characteristics of objects. Commonly used methods include the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). These features capture essential information about the objects' appearance, shape, and texture.

### Object Localization

Object localization involves determining the spatial coordinates of objects within the image.

 This is typically achieved by identifying the boundaries of objects through techniques like edge detection, contour detection, or region proposal algorithms. The result is a bounding box that tightly encloses each detected object.

### Classification

Once objects are localized, object detection algorithms assign class labels to each detected object. Classification can be performed using machine learning techniques like Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests, or CNNs. The model has been previously trained on a dataset with annotated examples of different object classes, allowing it to learn to recognize and classify objects accurately.

### Post-processing

In the post-processing step, the object detection algorithm refines the results to improve the overall quality. This may involve filtering out detections based on their confidence scores, removing overlapping or redundant bounding boxes, or applying heuristics to handle edge cases or false positives.

Object detection can be applied to a wide range of applications, including autonomous driving, surveillance systems, robotics, and image understanding tasks. The accuracy and performance of object detection algorithms depend on factors such as the quality of training data, the choice of features and algorithms, and the computational resources available.

It's important to note that object detection is an active area of research, and there are several algorithms and frameworks available to perform object detection, including Faster R-CNN, YOLO (You Only Look Once), and SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector). These algorithms differ in their trade-offs between accuracy and speed, making them suitable for different use cases.

## YOLO

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a popular object detection algorithm known for its fast and real-time performance. It stands out for its ability to simultaneously predict object classes and bounding box coordinates in a single forward pass through a deep neural network.

Here's a simplified explanation of how YOLO works:

### Dividing the Image into Grid

YOLO divides the input image into a grid of cells. Each cell is responsible for predicting objects located within its boundaries.

### Anchor Boxes

YOLO uses pre-defined anchor boxes, which are a set of bounding box shapes with different aspect ratios. These anchor boxes are initially defined based on the characteristics of the dataset being used.

### Prediction

The neural network is designed to simultaneously predict multiple bounding boxes and their corresponding class probabilities within each grid cell. For each anchor box, the network predicts the coordinates (x, y, width, height) of the bounding box and the confidence score representing the likelihood of containing an object. It also predicts class probabilities for each object class.

### Non-Maximum Suppression

YOLO applies a post-processing step called non-maximum suppression (NMS) to remove duplicate or overlapping bounding box predictions. NMS selects the most confident detection among overlapping boxes based on a defined threshold.

### Output

The final output of the YOLO algorithm is a set of bounding boxes along with their class labels and confidence scores, representing the detected objects in the image.

YOLO's key advantages lie in its speed and efficiency. Since it performs object detection in a single pass through the neural network, it avoids the need for region proposals or sliding windows, resulting in faster inference times. This makes YOLO suitable for real-time applications like video analysis, robotics, and autonomous vehicles.

YOLO has evolved over time, and different versions such as YOLOv1, YOLOv2 (also known as YOLO9000), YOLOv3, and YOLOv4 have been introduced. These iterations have incorporated various improvements, including network architecture changes, feature extraction enhancements, and the use of more advanced techniques like skip connections and feature pyramid networks.

YOLO models are typically trained on large labeled datasets, such as COCO (Common Objects in Context), to learn to detect objects across multiple classes effectively. The training process involves optimizing the neural network parameters using techniques like backpropagation and gradient descent.

Keep in mind that while YOLO offers fast inference times, it may sacrifice some accuracy compared to slower, more complex object detection algorithms. The choice of object detection algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the application, balancing factors like accuracy, speed, and available computational resources.

## How to Use YOLO with DroneBuddy

The object detection functionality uses the YOLO offline model. The list of objects it can detect can be found [here](https://github.com/arunponnusamy/object-detection-opencv/blob/master/yolov3.txt).

### Initialize the Object Detection Engine

```python
# Initialize the object detection engine
Object_detection_engine = dbl.init_yolo_engine(path_to_the_weight_file)
```

The weights link can be downloaded from [here](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights). The weights file will be provided to you; add it to your project folder. Please pass the absolute path if you need to use them. The example would be:

```python
r"C:\Users\malshadz\projects\DroneBuddy\DroneBuddyPilot\resources\objectdetection\yolov3.weights"
```

Once the initialization is complete, you can use the `get_label_yolo` method.

```python
# Example of using YOLO for object detection
image_frame = tello.get_frame_read().frame
formatted_image = cv2.resize(image_frame, (500, 500))
labels = dbl.get_label_yolo(Object_detection_engine, formatted_image)
```

# Voice Generation

## General

Text-to-speech (TTS) is a technology that converts written text into spoken words. It enables computers and other devices to generate human-like speech by processing and synthesizing text input.

Here's a simplified explanation of how text-to-speech works:

### Text Processing

The input text is processed to remove any unwanted characters, punctuation, or formatting. It may also involve tokenization, which breaks the text into smaller units such as words or phonemes for further analysis.

### Linguistic Analysis

The processed text is analyzed to extract linguistic features and interpret the meaning of the words and sentences. This analysis may involve tasks like part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing, and semantic understanding to ensure accurate pronunciation and intonation.

### Speech Synthesis

Once the linguistic analysis is complete, the text is transformed into speech signals. This is typically done through speech synthesis algorithms that generate the corresponding waveforms based on the linguistic information.

### Concatenative Synthesis

One approach is concatenative synthesis, where pre-recorded segments of human speech (called "units") are stored in a database. These units are selected and concatenated together to form the synthesized speech. This method can produce natural-sounding results but requires a large database of recorded speech.

### Formant Synthesis

Another approach is formant synthesis, which generates speech by modeling the vocal tract and manipulating its resonances (formants). By controlling the formants' frequencies and amplitudes, synthetic speech is produced. Formant synthesis allows for more control over the speech output but may sound less natural compared to concatenative synthesis.

### Parametric Synthesis

Parametric synthesis uses mathematical models to represent speech characteristics. It employs a set of parameters, such as pitch, duration, and spectral envelope, to generate speech waveforms. Parametric synthesis allows for efficient storage and customization of speech but may require additional processing to sound natural.

### Voice and Prosody

TTS systems often have multiple voices available, each representing a different speaker or style. The selected voice determines the characteristics of the generated speech, such

 as pitch, intonation, and accent. Prosody refers to the rhythm, stress, and intonation patterns in speech, and TTS systems incorporate prosodic rules to make the synthesized speech sound more natural and expressive.

### Output

The final output of the TTS system is the synthesized speech, which can be played back through speakers, headphones, or integrated into applications, devices, or services for various purposes like accessibility, voice assistants, audiobooks, or interactive systems.

TTS technology has made significant advancements in recent years, leveraging machine learning and deep neural networks to improve the naturalness and quality of synthesized speech. Deep learning models, such as WaveNet and Tacotron, have demonstrated impressive results in generating high-fidelity and expressive speech.

It's important to note that TTS systems require training on large datasets of recorded speech to produce accurate and natural-sounding results. The quality and performance of TTS systems can vary depending on the available resources, language, voice dataset, and synthesis techniques used.
